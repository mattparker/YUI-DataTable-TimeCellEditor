The TimeCellEditor class provides functionality for inline editing
DataTable cell data that are times.

It uses 24 hour clock, giving a form element with two select elements, one for
hours and one for minutes.  It expects times in the data cells to be in
format hh:mm.


Can be setup in the same way as other editors, in the datatable column defn:

{key:"time", editor: new YAHOO.widget.TimeCellEditor({disableBtns:true})}

No extra config options are available over the BaseCellEditor.
